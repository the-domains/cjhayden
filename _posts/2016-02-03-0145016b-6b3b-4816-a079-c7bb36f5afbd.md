Since 1992, I've been helping entrepreneurs get clients, get strategic, and get things done.
I'm an author, business coach, and strategic advisor who writes, coaches, and teaches on business-building, authentic success, and social good. Please explore my books and home-study courses, upcoming events, current projects, or find out how to work with me.
